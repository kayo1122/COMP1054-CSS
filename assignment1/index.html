        <p>
          "Hallelujah" is a song written by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, originally released on his 1984 album Various Positions. The song has been covered by many artists, but Jeff Buckley's version, released in 1994 on his album Grace, is one of the most famous and critically acclaimed renditions. Buckley's hauntingly beautiful interpretation of the song has made it a timeless classic, often associated with themes of love, loss, and spirituality.

        <p>
          Jeff Buckley was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for his exceptional vocal range and emotive performances. Born in 1966, Buckley was the son of Tim Buckley, another influential musician. Jeff's music blended elements of rock, folk, and blues, and he gained a cult following with his only studio album, Grace. Tragically, Buckley died in 1997 at the age of 30, but his music continues to resonate with fans around the world.

          <ul>
           <li>"Maybe there's a God above</li>
           <li>But all I've ever learned from love</li>
           <li>Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya</li>
           <li>And it's not a cry that you hear at night</li>
           <li>It's not somebody who's seen the light</li>
           <li>It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"</li>
          <li>- Jeff Buckley</li>
